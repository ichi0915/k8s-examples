# Update the newly created pod 'simple-webapp-2' with a readinessProbe using the given spec
kubectl get pod/simple-webapp-2 -o yaml > deploy.yml
# vim
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /ready
        port: 8080
# Delete, Apply

# What would happen if the application inside container on one of the PODs crashes?
The container inside the pod is restarted
# When the application crashes, the container is restarted. During this period the service directs users to the available POD, since the POD status is not READY.

# What would happen if the application inside container on one of the PODs freezes?
Users are impacted

# Update both the pods with a livenessProbe using the given spec
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /live
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 80
      periodSeconds: 1
    readinessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /ready
        port: 8080

# == Different practice but short, this is for loging

# A user - USER5 - has expressed concerns accessing the application. Identify the cause of the issue.
#Inspect the logs of the POD
k logs -f pod/webapp-1

# A user is reporting issues while trying to purchase an item. Identify the user and the cause of the issue.
# Inspect the logs of the webapp in the POD
k logs -f pod/webapp-2
